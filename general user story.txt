User Story: Create and Manage Tasks

As a user
I want to create, view, edit, and delete tasks
So that I can effectively manage my daily to-do list and keep track of what needs to be done.

Acceptance Criteria:

        The user can click on a "New Task" button.
        The user can enter a task title and optional description.

        The user can save the task, which will then appear in the task list.

    View Task:
        The user can see a list of all tasks, displaying the title and due date.
        The user can click on a task to view its details, including the description and due date.

    Edit Task:
        The user can click on a task in the list to edit its title, description, and due date.
        The user can save the changes, which will update the task in the list.

    Delete Task:
        The user can delete a task from the list.
        A confirmation prompt will appear before the task is deleted.
        Once confirmed, the task is removed from the list.

        The user can mark a task as completed.
        Completed tasks will appear with a strikethrough in the list and can be filtered out.
